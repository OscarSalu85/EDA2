ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

We ensure that every line of our code has been created by ourselves and we haven’t copied or searched on any web page or used any AI tool such as ChatGPT, Perplexity… in order to create and develop our code. Since our first moment we have created our code without the necessity of copying anything, but what we have done is search in some web pages some information on how some aspects of the code (Json, structures…) works. This research was done solely to enhance our understanding and improve the quality of our code, ensuring it is both efficient and clear. Our goal has always been to make our code as clear and understandable as possible. We believe that clarity is essential for effective teamwork and collaboration.We are committed to ethical development practices. This includes acknowledging our sources of information when we research coding techniques. We promote a culture of transparency and collaboration within our team. Every member is encouraged to the principles of originality and ethical coding practices. We strive for continuous improvement in our coding practices. This involves ongoing learning and staying updated with the latest developments in coding standards and always maintaining the originality and integrity of our work.
